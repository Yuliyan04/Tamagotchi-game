   This project is an implementation to the retro Tamagotchi games. My project is adaptation to the game with logic similar to the original but with a bit differences. You can save your pet to files to interract with them again because the game is a console one. The pet design here has more attriubtes but the game's logic is the same - feed your pet to keep it alive if it loses its life - you lose it forever. Interesting feature here are the games you can play with your pet! Also my project has the feature to decrease some of the pet's stats every 30 seconds while playing the game.
